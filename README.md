### Introduction

Rendering Routes is a GoodReads clone drawn from inspiration of Mountain Project.

Our application allows users to locate climbs near them, add them to their climb list, and conquer them. Authorized users have the ability to add brand new crags and routes for others to explore, as well as leave reviews with any tips or comments on each individual route. 

Above all, Rendering Routes was created to share the love for climbing, and encourage growth within the climbing community.

#### Technologies Used

### Technical implementation details

 - Determining what we wanted the user to be able to create, update, and delete was important before beginning to ensure that other users information(their climb list, the crags, and routes they have created) wasn't lost inside the database.
 - Updating a route provided for some challenges. Implementing the update with a hidden form, while staying on the page without a redirect/refresh, took some trial and error.
